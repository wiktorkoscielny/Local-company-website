## General info
Simple website made while learning html, css and javascript. 
The website was created at the turn of 2021 and 2022.
The website was also created for the needs of a local hairdressing salon 
only as a courtesy and interestingly, 
it actually exists on the internet 
and offers information about the company.
The website is hosted on free Netifly static website hosting.
